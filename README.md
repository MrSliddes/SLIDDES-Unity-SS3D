Position or dock the window as you like.
2 foldouts are already opend for you, Tools and Assets. These are the main 2 foldouts you will be working with the most.

To start using the editor press the red "In Use" button. The button turns green when the editor is in use. You can also toggle the button "Enable SS3D (F6)" in the scene window or press F6 as a shortcut toggle.

Each button has a tooltip that shows when you hover over it for more information.

For Assets to show up that you can place with the brush and erase with the eraser buttons you will have to add a label to the Assets you would like to work with within the editor.
The label should be called "SS3D-Asset". If you would like the label to be named different you can rename it in the Settings foldout.

For more information on how to add a label to an Asset:

Once the Assets you want appear in the editor you can click on them to select them as your current brush output. The selected Asset will turn green. To start painting make sure the "In Use" button is green, you selected the brush and changed the scene view to 2D (or pressed the 2D button in the Tools foldout). Hold or press the left mouse button to start creating Hierarchy GameObjects.

The editor uses Unity Undo/Redo so you can press Ctrl+z or Ctrl+y. To erase objects you can press the eraser button in the Tools foldout and then press or hold the left mouse button over the objects you want to delete.
